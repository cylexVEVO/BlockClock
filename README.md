# Strict-Tomato
A Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by blocking sites during work timers and letting you browse during break timers.
Will port to other browsers soon.

**Important note:** I have contributed very little to this project. This is just a maintained fork with some pull requests put in, and cosmetic changes. 

**Pull requests:** Feel free to make some pull requests. I use this extension regularly and will do my best to merge good requests.
