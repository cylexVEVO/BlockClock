# Strict-Tomato
A Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by blocking sites during work timers and letting you browse during break timers.
Will port to other browsers soon.

**Important note:** I have contributed very little to this project. This is just a maintained fork with some pull requests put in, and cosmetic changes.
